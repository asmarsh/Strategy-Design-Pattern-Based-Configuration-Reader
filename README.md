Strategy-Design Pattern Based Configuration Reader

Create a new program based on Assignment #2 that utilizes the Strategy design pattern to obtain an
object that can read application settings and connection strings using the same interface. This program
will be similar to the SayHello program developed during class and uses the IConfigurationReader
interface as the data type.

You may use C++, VB, C#, or Java to implement this program as long as the following requirements are
met. A C++, VB, or C# project must be created in Visual Studio (version 2017 or 2019). Java programs
must be created in an Eclipse project format or provided in source code form with instructions on how
to compile and run the program. Regardless of the language used, the entire project must be
submitted as a single ZIP file that contains the project folder, source code, and any additional
documentation.
